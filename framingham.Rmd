# Causal Roadmap

## Step 0: Specify the Scientific Question

What is the effect of smoking on the ten-year development of Cardiovascular Disease? The target population is white middle-class men and women aged 30 to 62 (at baseline) in Framingham, Massachusetts. \textbf{Note: Professor Balzer's comment on our project description Google Document suggests this might be inadequate. Can we claim that our results generalize outside of Framingham? Why?}
