\section{Background Story}\label{background-story}}

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death and serious
illness in the United States. The Framingham Heart Study's objective was
to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CHD
by following its development over time in a large group of participants
who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CHD or suffered a heart
attack or stroke.

The researchers recruited 5,209 men and women between the ages of 30 and
70 from Framingham, Massachusetts, and began the first round of
extensive physical examinations and lifestyle interviews that they would
later analyze for common patterns related to CHD development. Over the
years, careful monitoring of the Framingham Study population has led to
the identification of the major CHD risk factors -- high blood pressure,
high blood cholesterol, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and physical
inactivity. We are interested how the extent of smoking affects the
development of CHD, specifically, it is not immediately obvious whether
smoking 5 cigarettes per day affects the development of CHD differently
than smoking 15 cigarettes per day does.

What is the effect of smoking on the ten-year development of Coronary
Heart Disease?

\hypertarget{target-population}{%
\paragraph{Target population}\label{target-population}}

The target population is white middle-class men and women aged 30 to 70
in the US.

The sameple in this study is white middle-class men and women aged 30 to
70 (at baseline) in Framingham, Massachusetts. The importance of the
major CHD risk factors identified in this group have been shown in other
studies to apply almost universally, even though the patterns of
distribution may vary. Thus, we are willing to generalize to the target
population.

The dataset is adapted from Framingham Heart Study. We assume that
Gender, Age, Education, and Number of Cigarettes per Day (\(A\)) were
collected in a questionnaire at baseline. Then, BMI, Diabetes Status,
Prevalence of Stroke, Prevalence of Hypertension, Indication of Blood
Pressure Medication, Total Cholesterol Level, Blood Pressure, and Heart
Rate were all collected after the questionnaire at a doctor's office.
Our outcome, Coronary Heart Disease, is collected at a 10-year follow
up. Note that this is unlike the original study. We assume our observed
data were generated by sampling \(n\) from a system described by our
structural causal model, so we have \(n = 4211\) copies of
\(O\overset{i.i.d}\sim \mathbb{P}_O\). We place no restrictions on the
statistical model \(\mathcal{M}\), which is thereby non-parametric. BMI
was binned using guidelines from the World Health Organization. Total
Cholesterol was binned using guidelines from the National Heart, Lung
and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Table 1 below shows the counts for each
variable in each bin of the exposure, as well as a \(\chi^2\)-test of
independence.

\hypertarget{step-4.-identifiability}{%
\subsection{Step 4. Identifiability}\label{step-4.-identifiability}}

Since we made no independence assumptions on our exogenous background
factors, we will need to make additional independence assumptions for
identifiability. For the target causal parameter in the SCM
\(\mathcal{M^*}\) to be identified from the observed data distribution,
we need to make a randomization and a positivity assumption.

\hypertarget{randomization-assumption}{%
\paragraph{1) Randomization
Assumption:}\label{randomization-assumption}}

Conditional on \(W\), the counterfactual outcome is independent of the
observed treatment: \(Y \perp A|W\). In this augmented/working SCM
(\(\mathcal{M^{**}}\)), the unmeasured background factor of \(A\)
(cigarettes smoked per day) is independent of the unmeasured background
factor of \(Y\) (10yr CHD), the unmeasured background factor of \(W\)
(baseline age, gender, education, diabetes, BMI), and the unmeasured
background factor of \(Z\) (prevalence of stroke, hypertension, blood
pressure, blood pressure medication, heart rate).

Since \(W\),\(Z\), and \(Y\) include SES and biological factors that
affect human health, we aviod assuming independence between their
unmeasured background factors. Thus, we consider it is more plausible to
make the indepedence assumptions listed. We do not adjust the mediator
\(Z\) to avoid opening a backdoor path. Under \(M^{**}\), the backdoor
criterion holds conditional on \(W\). Additional data on factors that
affect heath status and determinants could help with identifiability,
but those factors are not well-understood.

\begin{figure}[h]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{./dags/augmented_dag} 

}

\caption{Causal Graph for an augmented SCM}\label{fig:figc}
\end{figure}

\[U_A\perp U_Y,U_A\perp U_W,U_A\perp U_Z\]

\hypertarget{positivity-assumption}{%
\paragraph{2) Positivity Assumption:}\label{positivity-assumption}}

There must be a positive probability of each treatment condition within
each possible strata of \(W\). We need a positive probability of
cigarettes smoked per day in bin \(i\) for each strata of \(W\).

\[
\begin{aligned}
min_{i\in A}\mathbb{P}_0(A=i|W=w)>0\\
\text{for all}\ w \ \text{for which } 
\mathbb{P}_0(W = w) \geq 0
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(i\) denote the index of a bin of \(A\).

We are concerned about a positivity assumption violation since binning
covatiates could make particular stratas of \(W\) have low probabilities
of smoking certain numbers of cigarettes per day, especially a bin with
high numbers of cigarettes smoked per day. We can informally check for a
positivity assumption violation from tables of \(A\) given a strata of
\(W\). One table from a strata of \(W\) is shown below:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Table for Gender = 0 (Female), cigsPerDay (A) = [10,20) }
\small
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Strata & Education: 1 & Education: 2 & Education: 3 & Education: 4 & Education: NA \\ \hline
Age: [32, 42) & 16 & 26 & 16 & 11 &  1 \\ \hline
Age: [42, 49) & 23 & 33 & 17 & 10 &  0 \\ \hline
Age: [49, 56) & 16 & 12 & 8 & 2 &  3  \\ \hline
Age: [56, 70] & 15 & 11 & 5 & 1 &  0  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

From the table above, we can see that we have no female who smokes 10 to
less than 20 cigarettes per day with missing education level in the age
ranges {[}42, 49) and {[}56, 70{]} respectively. Thus, we have some
sparsity issue which could affect the estimator performance,
particularly the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW).

We also investigated the treatment mechanism by calculating the
predicted probability of each bin of \(A\) (the number of cigarettes
smoked per day) given a strata of \(W\):

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lrrr@{}}
\caption{Predicted Probabilities of A for each Strata of
W}\tabularnewline
\toprule
& Min & Mean & Max\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endfirsthead
\toprule
& Min & Mean & Max\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
0 cigarettes per day & 0.2853671 & 0.5085200 & 0.7440546\tabularnewline
{[}1,10) cigarettes per day & 0.0612951 & 0.1146543 &
0.1733320\tabularnewline
{[}10,19) cigarettes per day & 0.0592084 & 0.0925024 &
0.1428044\tabularnewline
{[}20,70{]} cigarettes per day & 0.0765399 & 0.2843233 &
0.5630990\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

From the table's minimum probability column, we can see that some
stratas of \(W\) have relatively low probabilities for the number of
cigarettes smoked per day in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th bin, which would
results in those stratas having high weights in the IPTW estimator.
However, the probabilities are not close to zero. Therefore, we do not
have a practical violation of positivity assumption. Theoretically,
randomizing the number of cigarettes smoked per day could rid of
positivity assumption violation concerns, but it is not feasible.

\hypertarget{step-5.-statistical-model-and-estimand}{%

The target parameter of \(\mathbb{P}_0\), which equals the causal

\hypertarget{statistical}{%
\subsubsection{Statistical}\label{statistical}}

From the estimation of our statistical model \(\mathcal{M}\), we found
that the probability of developing coronary heart disease increases as
the binned exposure (\texttt{cigsPerDay}) increases from, standardadized
to the distribution of baseline covariates \(W\). However, in bin \#2,
corresponding to \texttt{cigsPerDay} \(\in [1, 10)\), we found what
seems to be a ``protective'' effect, in which smoking less than a pack
of cigarettes as day is associated with a lower risk of CHD than not
smoking at all. The difference risk in this bin is estimated at around
0.10-0.11, compared with . We argue that this may be due to
\textit{non-differential misclassification}, since participants may have
not self-reported smoking due to the negative stigma associated with it.
For \texttt{cigsPerDay} \(\geq\) 20, the probability of CHD plateaus
near 0.2 (for the conditional mean outcome and IPTW estimators) and 0.16
(for TMLE).

\hypertarget{counterfactual}{%
\subsubsection{Counterfactual}\label{counterfactual}}

The estimated effect of the exposure is the counterfactual probability
of developiong coronary heart disease in 10 years under the exposure
category \texttt{cigsPerDay} (\(A_i, i \in \{1, 2, 3, 4 \}\)), with the
assumptions that conditioning on the baseline covariates \(W\) (age,
sex, \& education) and assumpting certain independence assumptions
satisfies the backdoor criterion, and said independence assumptions and
positivity holds. The observed general increase in estimated risk of CHD
as the (binned) exposure increases is certainly plausible; however, the
estimated reduction in risk of CHD for \texttt{cigsPerDay}
\(\in [1, 10)\) is less plausible, again perhaps due to biased data from
non-differential misclassification on the exposure, or could in fact be
evidence for a protective effect of low degrees of smoking on risk of
CHD.

\hypertarget{limitations}{%
\subsubsection{Limitations}\label{limitations}}

It is not likely that our target causal parameter is identifiable due to
violations of the chosen independence assumptions, and thus our
counterfactual estimation should not be accepted without some healthy
skepticism. Many unmeasured confounders are possible, including
pre-existing medical conditions not considered by the Framingham Heart
Study patient surveys, diet and exercise habits, family history, genetic
factors, and more. Future studies might expand the set of measured
variables to include such information. As mentioned, we are also
concerned about potential issues with reporting bias in the data.
Finally, we did not have access to time-varying aspects of the data;
e.g., smoking habits and biomarkers before or after baseline
measurements were taken, many of which could contain information
relevant to prediction of CHD outcomes.
